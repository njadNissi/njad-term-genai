explain me what you see in the image 

The image shows two men engaged in an arm wrestling match.  They are seated opposite each other at a simple wooden table.  The man on the left has short, dark hair and is wearing a white t-shirt. The man on the right is wearing a white baseball cap, a yellow and navy striped polo shirt, and maroon Puma sweatpants.  The background is a light blue banner with some Chinese characters and English words visible, suggesting it might be some sort of event or competition. The focus is on the arm wrestling itself, with the men's arms locked in a struggle.
